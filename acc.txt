narita japan passengers crew touched narita airports runway r bounced touched second time nose gear first aircraft settled runway l z rolled taxied apron passengers cabin crew received minor injuries aircraft received substantial damage first post flight examination revealed fuselage skin received numerous serious creases ahead wing root around circumference japans tsb confirmed aircraft received substantial damage opened investigation accident jun th jtsb reported initially reported minor injuries sprains bruises passengers cabin crew result hard landing aircraft sustained substantial damage main nose landing gear strut fuselage received wrinkles ahead leading edge wings cracks result deformation according flight data recorder right main gear contacted ground first lifted subsequently nose gear touched followed right left main gear nose gear lifted main gear settled runway flight data recorder recorded vertical acceleration g nose gear touched aerodrome recordings show wind time landing southwest speeds knots knots instantaneous average wind shown southwest knots data suggest strong gust right time landing aug st jtsb released final report concluding probable cause accident highly probable accident occurred damage aircraft result hard landing nose landing gear bounce attempting land runway r narita international airport probable hard landing nose landing gear caused captain could notice bounce aircraft controlled take nose position order make early touchdown nose landing gear probable continued landing aircraft unstable posture caused crosswind gust occurs strong southwest wind around airport contributed occurrence accident jtsb analysed approach flown autopilot feet autopilot disconnected jtsb wrote change pitch angle time became frequent within range ° ° adjustment operation pitch angle change made similar manner adjustment operation roll angle change addition speed time changing within range kt kt change frequent exceeding upper lower limits deviation call therefore probable difficult keep stabilized approach since aircraft nosedown attitude period decision altitude runway threshold since speed intermittently changed exceeding limits issue deviation call jtsb analysed events passing runway threshold right main gear touchdown pitch angle changed ° ° aircraft passed runway threshold nosedown operation made altitude ground ft nose began descend altitude ground ft flare operation commenced altitude ground level ft vertical acceleration decreased g aircraft nosedown attitude according description wind situation changed updraft downdraft updraft returning near zero magnitude moreover headwind component decreased crosswind component first increased decreased probable change pitch angle caused mainly nosedown operation also additionally influence wind disturbance according fig thrust lever operated slightly forward pitch angle decreased aircraft descended highly probable increase thrust engines enough sufficiently reduce descending rate statements indicate captain felt descent aircraft altitude ground ft descent rate data shown fig indicates ftmin period passed altitude ground level ft passing runway threshold touched accordingly highly probable descent rate could sufficiently reduced due failure making appropriate flare operations nose rose abruptly consequently order reduce nose momentary nose operation made reduced increasing rate pitch angle nose operation made gradual nose operation continued since runway r longer runway narita airport chosen landing aircraft probable could touch effectively taking advantage long length runway decreasing pitch passed runway threshold probable pitch significantly decreased passed runway threshold recognized appropriate landing operation would possible landing continued right main landing gear touched pitch angle ° roll angle ° speed kt following touchdown right main gear jtsb analysed according description fig aircraft rolled right angle ° took noseup attitude angle ° main landing gear touched first time vertical acceleration recorded fdr g time touch right main landing gear aircraft rolling left pitch angle descending second first touch right main landing gear aircraft rebounded air incidentally speedbrakes extend due touching right main landing gear pitch angle became negative nose nose landing gear touched touch nose landing gear right landing main gear touched left main landing gear touched vertical acceleration recorded fdr g time second touch nose landing gear rebounded air almost simultaneously speedbrakes extended thrust reverser began deploy according statements captain first officer highly probable could recognize bounce aircraft right main landing gear touched first time probable even central part fuselage main landing gears located bounced floated pilots cockpit might feel airframe floating nose lowered time cockpit located forward fuselage first officer make call speedbrake deployment however since time right main landing gear bounced nose landing gear touched one second probable captain pf could made operations responding bouncing even first officer made call according fig nosedown operation began immediately first touchdown right main landing gear probable nose operations made control increase pitch angle since nose rising fast probable nose operations resulted high nose speed nose landing gear touched addition effect right main landing gear bounced causing hard touch nose landing gear according statement described highly probable right main landing gear floated nose negative pitch captain noticed aircraft bounced floated touch nose landing gear captain controlled aircraft take full nose operation described highly probable control made since considered early touchdown nose landing gear would safer keep rolling direction touchdown strong crosswind nose operation touch described probable nosedown operation continued caused second hard touchdown nose landing gear jtsb analysed according pitching moments encountered nose gear exposed force lb first well second touchdown nose gear exceeded design limits therefore probable damage forward fuselage upper crown caused either first second hard touchdowns nose gear
